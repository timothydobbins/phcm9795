  abstract = {Now in its Fourth Edition, An Introduction to Medical Statistics continues to be a 'must-have' textbook for anyone who needs a clear logical guide to the subject. Written in an easy-to-understand style and packed with real life examples, the text clearly explains the statistical principles used in the medical literature.   Taking readers through the common statistical methods seen in published research and guidelines, the text focuses on how to interpret and analyse statistics for clinical practice. Using extracts from real studies, the author illustrates how data can be employed correctly and incorrectly in medical research helping readers to evaluate the statistics they encounter and appropriately implement findings in clinical practice.   End of chapter exercises, case studies and multiple choice questions help readers to apply their learning and develop their own interpretative skills. This thoroughly revised edition includes new chapters on meta-analysis, missing data, and survival analysis.},

  abstract = {THIRTY years have elapsed since the publication of the first clinical trials employing randomization.1 Since then the randomized control trial has gradually become accepted as the most effective way of determining the relative efficacy and toxicity of a new therapy. A persisting objection to the trial has been its inability to document the efficacy of therapies considered by their advocates to be clinically most useful. This inability could be insensitivity, or it could be that the initial enthusiasm for the therapy was based on inadequate or biased trials. The purpose of the present study was to examine a number of . . .},
