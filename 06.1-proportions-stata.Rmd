# **6** Stata notes {-}

## 95% confidence intervals for proportions
To compute the 95% confidence interval for proportions, go to Statistics > Summaries, tables, and tests > Summary and descriptive statistics >Proportion CI calculator. In the cii dialog box as shown below, key in 215 as the Sample size and 47 as the number of Successes. Choose Wald for the normal approximation to binomial distribution CI [Command: cii 215 47, wald] or Wilson for Wilson CI [Command: cii 215 47, wilson]. Click OK or Submit when you are done to obtain the outputs shown in the course notes for Worked Example 6.1.

```{r s-cii, echo=FALSE, out.width = "400pt",}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod06", "stata", "cii.png"))
```

## Significance test for single proportion
To perform a binomial test using the data from Example_6.3.dta, it would be a good idea to check that the variable is dichotomous and numerically coded in 0 and 1 by using the codebook command. [Command: codebook smoking_status]

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, highlight=FALSE}
. codebook smoking_status 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
smoking_status                                                    Smoking status
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                  type:  numeric (double)
                 label:  smoking_status

                 range:  [0,1]                        units:  1
         unique values:  2                        missing .:  0/300

            tabulation:  Freq.   Numeric  Label
                           246         0  Non-smokers
                            54         1  Smokers
```

After checking the data, perform the binomial probability test by going to **Statistics > Summaries, tables, and tests > Classical tests of hypotheses > Binomial probability test**. Select `Smoking_status` as the **Binomial variable**. The probability we want to test against is entered in the **Probability of success** box. To test that the sample proportion (0.18) is different from the population proportion of 0.2, we enter 0.2 as the **Probability of success**.

Click **OK** or **Submit** to obtain Output 6.3.

```{r s-bitest, echo=FALSE, out.width = "400pt",}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod06", "stata", "bitest.png"))
```

[Command: `bitest smoking_status == 0.2`]

If you have only the aggregate data then the same test can be carried out using the immediate command. For that you will need to go through perform the binomial 
probability test by going to **Statistics > Summaries, tables, and tests > Classical tests of hypotheses > Binomial probability test calculator**. Enter the numbers in the appropriate fields as shown below.

```{r s-bitesti, echo=FALSE, out.width = "400pt",}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod06", "stata", "bitesti.png"))
```

[Command: bitesti 300 54 0.2]

## Computing a relative risk and its 95% confidence interval

Using data file from Worked Example 6.4, to obtain relative risk and its 95% CI, go to **Statistics > Epidemiology and related > Tables for epidemiologists > Cohort study risk ratio etc...**

```{r s-cs-1, echo=FALSE, out.width = "400pt",}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod06", "stata", "cs-1.png"))
```

In the **cs â€“ cohort studies** dialog box, select the variable `side_effect` in the **Case variable** box, and the variable `group` in the **Exposed variable** box. Click **OK** or **Submit** to obtain Output 6.4 in the notes.

```{r s-cs-2, echo=FALSE, out.width = "400pt",}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod06", "stata", "cs-2.png"))
```

[Command: `cs side_effect group`]

If you only have the cross-tabulated data (i.e. aggregated), you can go to **Statistics > Epidemiology and related > Tables for epidemiologists > Cohort study risk ratio etc. calculator**. In the **csi** dialog box, key in the relevant numbers from the cross-tabulated data (similarly to the cci dialog box above). Click **OK** or **Submit** to obtain Output 6.4.

```{r s-cs-3, echo=FALSE, out.width = "400pt",}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod06", "stata", "cs-3.png"))
```

[Command: `csi 15 4 35 46`]


## Computing an odds ratio and its 95%CI

To obtain an odds ratio and its 95% CI, go to **Statistics > Epidemiology and related > Tables for epidemiologists > Case-control odds ratio**. The **cc** dialog box is completed as for the **cs** dialog box.

To obtain the Cornfield confidence interval, click on the Options tab and select the Cornfield approximation radio button.

```{r s-cc-1, echo=FALSE, out.width = "400pt",}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod06", "stata", "cc-1.png"))
```

If you only have the cross-tabulated data (i.e. aggregated), you can go to Statistics > Epidemiology and related > Tables for epidemiologists > Case-control odds ratio calculator. In the cci dialog box, enter the numbers from the cross-tabulated data and select the Cornfield approximation radio button. For example, Worked example 6.5 would be entered as:

```{r s-cc-2, echo=FALSE, out.width = "400pt",}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "mod06", "stata", "cc-2.png"))
```
