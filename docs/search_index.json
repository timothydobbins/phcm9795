Construct an appropriate graph to display the relative frequency of participants’ weight loss. Your graph should start at 50 grams, with weight loss grouped into 50 gram bins. Provide appropriate labels for the axes and give the graph an appropriate title. Activity 1.2 Researchers at a maternity hospital in the 1970s conducted a study of low birth weight babies. Low birth weight is classified as a weight of 2,500g or less at birth. Data were collected on age and smoking status of mothers and the birth weight of their babies. The Stata file Activity_S1.2.dta contains data on the participants in the study. The file is located on Moodle in the Learning Activities section. Use Stata to create a 2 by 2 table to show the proportions of low birth weight babies born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy and those that did not smoke during pregnancy. Answer the following questions: What was the total number of mothers who smoked during pregnancy? What proportion of mothers who smoked gave birth to low birth weight babies? What proportion of non-smoking mothers gave birth to low birth weight babies? Use Stata to construct a stacked bar chart of the data to examine if there a difference in the proportion of babies born with a low birth weight in relation to mother’s age?

(Acock 2010) Section 7.11. 9.1 Introduction In general, parametric statistics are preferred for reporting data because the summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, standard error of the mean etc) and the tests used (t-tests, correlation, regression etc) are familiar and the results are easy to communicate. However, non-parametric tests can be used if data are not normally distributed. Non-parametric tests make fewer assumptions about the distribution of the data. 9.2 Transforming non-normally distributed variables When a variable has a skewed distribution, one possibility is to transform the data to a new variable to try and obtain a normal or near normal distribution. Methods to transform non-normally distributed data include logarithmic transformation of each data point, or using the square root or the square or the inverse (i.e. 1/x) etc. 9.2.1 Worked Example We have data from 132 patients who had a hospital stay following admission to ICU available on Moodle (Example_9.1.dta). The distribution of the length of stay for these patients is shown in the histogram in Figure 9.1. As is common with variables that record time, the data are skewed with many patients having relatively short stays and a few patients having very long hospital stays. Clearly, it would not be possible to use parametric statistical methods for these data. INSERT FIGURE Figure 9.1 Length of hospital stay in 132 patients When data are positively skewed, as shown in Figure 9.1, a logarithmic transformation can often make the data closer to being normally distributed. This is the most common transformation used. You should note, however, that the logarithmic function cannot handle 0 or negative values. One way to deal with zeros in a set of data is to add 1 to each value before taking the logarithm. In Stata, we can use the generate command to obtain a new variable, as shown in the Stata Notes section. As the minimum length of stay in these sample data was 0, we have added 1 to each length of stay before taking the logarithm. The distribution of the logarithm of (length of stay + 1) is shown in Figure 9.2. INSERT FIGURE Figure 9.2 Distribution of log transformed (length of stay + 1) The distribution now appears much more bell shaped. Output 9.1 shows the descriptive statistics for length of stay before and after logarithmic transformation. Before transformation, the SD is almost as large as the mean value which indicates that the data are skewed and that these statistics are not an accurate description of the centre and spread of the data.

If we raise the mean of the log of length of stay to the power of \\(e\\), it returns a value of 30.2 days (\\(e^{3.41}=30.2\\)). To do this in Stata, you can use the display command that was shown in Module 2 and with the exponential function, exp(). Technically, this is called the geometric mean of the data, and it has a different interpretation to the usual mean, the arithmetic mean. This is a much better estimate in this case of the “average” length of stay than the mean of 38.1 days (95% CI 31.9, 44.2 days) obtained from the non-transformed positively skewed data. Note that, if you have added 1 to your data to deal with 0 values, the back-transformed estimate is approximately equal to the geometric mean. If we were testing the hypothesis that there was a difference in length of stay between groups (status of nosocomial infection), t-tests could not be used with length of stay but could be used for the log transformed variable, which is approximately normally distributed. The output from the t-test of the log-transformed length of stay is shown in Output 9.2. This is done using the t-test shown in Module 5.

From Output 9.2, we can take the exponential of the corresponding log-transformed values: the geometric mean of the infected group is approximately 41.5 days with a 95% confidence interval from 31.4 to 55.0 days. the geometric mean of the uninfected group is approximately 27.9 days with a 95% confidence interval from 24.4 to 31.9 days. 9.3 Non-parametric significance tests It is often not possible or sensible to transform a non-normal distribution, for example if there are too many zero values or when we simply want to compare groups using the unit in which the measurement was taken (e.g. length of stay). For this, non-parametric significance tests can be used but the general idea behind these tests is that the data values are replaced by ranks. This also protects against outliers having too much influence. 9.3.1 Ranking variables Table 9.1 shows how ranks are calculated for the first 21 patients in the length-of-stay data (Example_9.1.dta). First the data are sorted in order of their magnitude (from the lowest value to the highest) ignoring the group variable. Each data point is then assigned a rank. Data points that are equal are assigned the mean of their ranks. Thus, the two lengths of stay of 11 days share the ranks 4 and 5, and have a mean rank of 4.5. Similarly, there are 5 people with a length of stay of 14 days and these share the ranks 9 to 13, the mean of which is 11. Once ranks are computed they are assigned to each of the two groups and summed within each group. Table 9.1: Transforming data to ranks: first 21 participants IDInfectionLength of stayRankInfection=noInfection=Yes 32No011 33No122 12No933 22No114.54.5 16No114.54.5 28Yes1266 27No137.57.5 20No137.57.5 24No141111 11No141111 130No141111 10No141111 25No141111 19No1515.515.5 30No1515.515.5 23No1515.515.5 14No1515.515.5 15No1720.520.5 13No1720.520.5 21Yes1720.520.5 17No1720.520.5 By assigning ranks to individuals, we lose information about their actual values and this makes it more difficult to detect a difference. However, outliers and extreme values in the data are brought back closer to the data so that they are less influential. For this reason, non-parametric tests have less power than parametric tests and they require much larger differences in the data to show statistical significance between groups. 9.4 Non-parametric test for two independent samples (Wilcoxon ranked sum test) The non-parametric equivalent to an independent samples t-test (Module 5) is the Wilcoxon ranked sum test, also known as the Mann-Whitney U test. In Stata, this can be obtained using the ranksum command. The assumption for this test is that the distributions of the two populations have the same general shape. If this assumption is met, then this test evaluates the null hypothesis that the medians of the two populations are equal. This test does not assume that the populations are normally distributed, nor that their variances are equal. For the length of stay data in the Worked Example 9.1, we first get a ranks table as shown in Output 9.3. The rank sum table gives us a direction of effect that the ranks are higher than expected in patients who had nosocomial infection. While the positive infection group has a lower sum of ranks because there were fewer people who contracted an infection, it is higher than expected, i.e. they have a longer length of stay compared with the negative infection group. This ranks table does not provide any summary statistics of direction of effect, central tendency or spread that describe the data.

The variance shown immediately under the table are used to conduct the test, and are not reported on. From the output 9.3, there are two P-values shown: one assuming normality of the ranks (not the underlying data), and an “Exact” P-value. The exact P-value is calculated when the sample size is not too large (less than 200), and is preferred. The rounded exact P value is 0.014 which indicates that the there is evidence of a difference in length of stay between the groups. This P-value should be provided alongside non-parametric summary statistics such as medians and inter-quartile ranges. Using the summary command with the detail option in Stata and splitting the LOS variable by the Infect variable (as shown in Module 5), we can obtain the median length of stay values of 24 (Interquartile Range: 19 to 40 days) in the group with no infection and 37 (Interquartile Range: 24 to 50 days) in the group with infection. 9.5 Non-parametric test for paired data (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) There are two types of non-parametric tests for paired data, called the Sign test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test. In practice, the Sign test is rarely used and will not be discussed in this course. If the differences between two paired measurements are not normally distributed, a non-parametric equivalent of a paired t-test (Module 5) should be used. The equivalent test is the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, also simply called the Wilcoxon matched-pairs test. This test is resistant to outliers in the data, however the proportion of outliers in the sample should be small. This test evaluates the null hypothesis that the median of the paired differences is equal to zero. In this test, the absolute differences between the paired scores are ranked and the difference scores that are equal to zero (i.e. scores where there is no difference between the pairs) are excluded. Thus, the test is not suitable when a large proportion of the differences are zero because the effective sample size is reduced considerably. 9.5.1 Worked Example A crossover trial is done to compare symptom scores for two drugs in 11 people with arthritis (higher scores indicate more severe symptoms). The data are contained in Stata datafile file Example_9.2.dta. The data are shown in Table 9.2. The descriptive statistics indicate that the differences are not normally distributed. You can use the Explore function in Stata to determine this. Table 9.2: Arthritis symptom scores for 11 patients after administering two drugs Patient IDScore: Drug 1Score: Drug 2Difference (Drug 2 – Drug 1) 1341 2275 3341 48102 5682 661-5 7264 8374 9583 109101 11781 Before doing the analysis let us examine the distribution of the difference of symptom scores between the two drugs. As in Module 5, we first need to compute the difference between the symptom scores. To examine the distribution, we plot a histogram as shown in Figure 9.3. Figure 9.3: Distribution of difference in symptom scores between Drug 1 and Drug 2 UPDATE The histogram that the differences are not normally distributed. The data looks negatively skewed with a gap in the histogram between the values of -5 and 0. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to conduct a paired t-test. Hence, we conduct a non-parametric paired test (Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test). A non-parametric paired test can be obtained in Stata using the signrank command and the results of the test are shown in Output 9.4. Output 9.4: Results from Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test Wilcoxon signed-rank test sign | obs sum ranks expected -------------+--------------------------------- positive | 1 10.5 33 negative | 10 55.5 33 zero | 0 0 0 -------------+--------------------------------- all | 11 66 66 unadjusted variance 126.50 adjustment for ties -1.63 adjustment for zeros 0.00 ---------- adjusted variance 124.88 Ho: drug_1 = drug_2 z = -2.013 Prob &gt; |z| = 0.0441 Exact Prob = 0.0459 The table in Output 9.4 shows that there is 1 person who has a positive difference, where the symptom score on drug 2 that is smaller than that for drug 1 (i.e., drug 2 is better than drug 1); and 10 people who have a negative difference. No one has the same score for both drugs. The difference scores are ranked and the observed and expected sum of the ranks are shown in the output. This provides no intuitive summary statistics except to indicate which drug has higher ranks. The test statistics are also shown under the table in Output 9.4. From the output, the exact P value of 0.046 indicates that there is evidence of a difference in symptom score between the two drugs. 9.6 Non-parametric estimates of correlation Estimating correlation using Pearson’s correlation coefficient can be problematic when bivariate Normality cannot be assumed, or in the presence of outliers or skewness. There are two commonly used non-parametric alternatives to Pearson’s correlation coefficient: Spearman’s rank correlation (\\(\\rho\\) or rho), and Kendall’s rank correlation (\\(\\tau\\) or tau). When estimating the correlation between x and y, Spearman’s rank correlation essentially replaces the observations x and y by their ranks, and calculates the correlation between the ranks. Kendall’s rank correlation compares the ranks between every possible combination of pairs of data to measure concordance: whether high values for x tend to be associated with high values for y (positively correlated) or low values of y (negatively correlated). In terms of which is the more appropriate measure to use, the following passage from An Introduction to Medical Statistics, 4th Edition (Bland 2015) provides some guidance: “Why have two different rank correlation coefficients? Spearman’s \\(\\rho\\) is older than Kendall’s \\(\\tau\\), and can be thought of as a simple analogue of the product moment correlation coefficient, Pearson’s r. Kendall’s \\(\\tau\\) is a part of a more general and consistent system of ranking methods, and has a direct interpretation, as the difference between the proportions of concordant and discordant pairs. In general, the numerical value of \\(\\rho\\) is greater than that of \\(\\tau\\). It is not possible to calculate \\(\\tau\\) from \\(\\rho\\) or \\(\\rho\\) from \\(\\tau\\), they measure different sorts of correlation. \\(\\rho\\) gives more weight to reversals of order when data are far apart in rank than when there is a reversal close together in rank, \\(\\tau\\) does not. However, in terms of tests of significance, both have the same power to reject a false null hypothesis, so for this purpose it does not matter which is used.” We will illustrate estimating rank correlation using the Stata file Example_8.1.dta, which has information about height and lung function collected from a sample of 120 adults. Output 9.5: Results from rank correlation analysis . spearman Height FVC Number of obs = 120 Spearman&#39;s rho = 0.7476 Test of Ho: Height and FVC are independent Prob &gt; |t| = 0.0000 . ktau Height FVC Number of obs = 120 Kendall&#39;s tau-a = 0.5431 Kendall&#39;s tau-b = 0.5609 Kendall&#39;s score = 3878 SE of score = 439.463 (corrected for ties) Test of Ho: Height and FVC are independent Prob &gt; |z| = 0.0000 (continuity corrected) The Spearman rank correlation coefficient is estimated as 0.75, demonstrating a positive association between height and FVC. Stata provides two versions of the Kendall rank correlation coefficient: we would use tau-b (\\(\\tau_b\\)) as it allows for tied observations. The Kendall rank correlation coefficient is estimated as 0.56, again demonstrating a positive association between height and FVC. 9.7 Summary In this module, we have presented methods to conduct a hypothesis test with data that are not normally distributed. Non-parametric methods do not assume any distribution for the data and use significance tests based on ranks or sign (or both). A non-parametric test is always less powerful than its equivalent parametric test if the data are normally distributed and so whenever possible parametric significance tests should be used. In some cases when data are not normally distributed with a reasonably large sample size, the data can be transformed (most commonly by log transformation) to make the distribution normal. A parametric significance test should then be used with the transformed data to test the hypothesis.

Further readings (for interest) Woodward (2013); Chapter 8. 10.1 Introduction Determining the appropriate sample size (the number of participants in a study) is one of the most critical issues when designing a research study. A common question when planning a project is “How many participants do I need?” The sample size needs to be large enough to ensure that the results can be generalised to the population and will be accurate, but small enough for the study question to be answered with the resources available. In general, the larger the sample size, the more precise the study results will be. Unfortunately, estimating the sample size required for a study is not straightforward and the method used varies with the study design and the type of statistical test that will be conducted on the data collected. In the past, researchers calculated the sample size by hand using complicated mathematical formula. More recently, look-up tables have been created which has removed the need for hand calculations. Now, most researchers use computer programs where parameters relevant to the particular study design are entered and the sample size is automatically calculated. In this module, we will use an abbreviated look-up table to demonstrate the parameters that need to be considered when estimating sample sizes for a confidence interval and use Stata for all other sample size calculations. The look-up table allows you to see at a glance, the impact of different factors on the sample size estimation. 10.1.1 Under and over-sized studies In health research, there are different implications for interpreting the results if the sample size is too small or too large. An under-sized study is one which lacks the power to find an effect or association when, in truth, one exists. If the sample size is too small, an important difference between groups may not be statistically significant and so will not be detected by the study. In fact, it is considered unethical to conduct a health study which is poorly designed so that it is not possible to detect an effect or association if it exists. Often, Ethics Committees request evidence of sample size calculations before a study is approved. A classic paper by Freiman et al examined 71 randomised controlled trials which reported an absence of clinical effect between two treatments.(Freiman et al. 1978) Many of the trials were too small to show that a clinically important difference was statistically significant. If the sample size of an analytic study is too small, then only very limited conclusions can be drawn about the results. In general, the larger the sample size the more precise the estimates will be. However, large sample sizes have their own effect on the interpretation of the results. An over-sized study is one in which a small difference between groups, which is not important in clinical or public health terms, is statistically significant. When the study sample is large, the null hypothesis could be rejected in error and research resources may be wasted. This type of study may be unethical due to the unnecessary enrolment of a large number of people. 10.2 Sample size estimation for descriptive studies To estimate the sample size required for a descriptive study, we usually focus on specifying the width of the confidence interval around our primary estimate. For example, to estimate the sample size for a study designed to measure a prevalence we need to: nominate the expected prevalence based on other available evidence; nominate the required level of precision around the estimate. For this, the width of the 95% confidence interval (i.e. the distance equal to 1.96 \\(\\times\\) SE) is used. Table 10.1 is an abbreviated look-up table that we can use to estimate the sample size for this type of study. Note that the sample size required to detect an expected population prevalence of 5% is the same as to detect a prevalence of 95%. Similarly 10% is equivalent to 90% etc. It is symmetric about 50%. From Table 10.1, you can see that the sample size required increases as the expected prevalence approaches 50% and as the precision increases (i.e. the required 95% CI becomes narrower). Table 10.1: Sample size required to calculate a 95\\% confidence interval with a given precision Width of 95% confidence interval (precision) Prevalence1%1.5%2%2.5%3%3.5%4%5%10%15% 5% or 95%1,825812457292203149115 10% or 90%3,4581,537865554385283217139 15% or 85%4,8992,1771,22578454540030719649 20% or 80%6,1472,7321,5379846835023852466228 25% or 75%7,2033,2021,8011,1538015884512897333 10.2.1 Worked Example A descriptive cross-sectional study is designed to measure the prevalence of bronchitis in children age 0-2 years with a 95% CI of \\(\\pm\\) 4%. The prevalence is expected to be 20%. From the table, a sample size of at least 385 will be required for the width of the 95% CI to be \\(\\pm\\) 4% (i.e. the reported precision of the summary statistic will be 20% (95% CI 16% to 24%)). If the prevalence turns out to be higher than the researchers expected or if they decided that they wanted a narrower 95% CI (i.e. increase precision), a larger sample size would be required. What sample size would be required if the prevalence was 15% and the desired 95% CI was \\(\\pm\\) 3%? Answer: 545 10.3 Sample size estimation for analytical studies Analytical study designs are used to compare characteristics between different groups in the population. The main study designs are analytical cross-sectional studies, case-control studies, cohort studies and randomised controlled trials. For analytical study designs, the outcome measure of interest can be a mean value, a proportion or a relative risk if a random sample has been enrolled. For case-control studies the most appropriate measure of association is an odds ratio. 10.3.1 Factors to be considered The first important decision in estimating a required sample size for an analytic study is to select the type of statistical test that will be used to report or analyse the data. Each type of test is associated with a different method of sample size estimation. Once the statistical method has been determined, the following issues need to be decided: - Statistical power – the chance of finding a difference if one exists, e.g. 80%; - Level of significance – the P value that will be considered significant, e.g. P&lt;0.05; - Minimum effect size of interest – the size of the difference between groups e.g. the difference in the proportion of parents who oppose immunisation in two different regions or the difference in mean values of blood pressure in two groups of people with different types of cardiac disease; - Variability – the spread of the measurements, e.g. the expected standard deviation of the main outcome variable (if continuous), or the expected proportions; - Resources – an estimate of the number of participants available and amount of funding to run the study. In addition to deciding the level of power and probability that will be used, the difference between groups that is regarded as being important has to be estimated. The smallest difference between study groups that we want to detect is described as the minimum expected effect size. This is determined on the basis of clinical judgement, public health importance and expertise in the condition being researched, or may it be need to be determined from a pilot study or a literature review. The smaller the expected effect or association, the larger the sample size will need to obtain statistical significance. We also need some knowledge of how variable the measurement is expected to be. For this we often use the standard deviation for a continuous measure. As measurement variability increases, the sample size will need to increase in order to detect the expected difference between the groups. Above all, a study has to be practical in terms of the availability of a population from which to draw sufficient numbers for the study and in terms of the funds that are available to conduct the study. 10.3.2 Power and significance level The power of a study, which was discussed in Module 4, is the chance of finding a statistically significant difference when one exists, i.e. the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis. The relationship between the power of a study and statistical significance is shown in Table 10.2. Table 10.2 Comparison of study results with the truth Study result Truth Effect No effect Effect ✔️ α (Type I error) No effect β (Type II error) ✔️ The power of a study is expressed as 1– β where β is the probability of a false negative (that is, the probability of a Type II error - incorrectly not rejecting the null hypothesis. In most research, power is generally set to 80% (a Type II error rate of 20%). However, in some studies, especially in some clinical trials where rigorous results are required, power is set to 90% (a Type II error rate of 10%). The significance level, or α level, is the level at which the P value of a test is considered to be statistically significant. The α level is usually set at 5% indicating a probability of &lt;0.05 will be regarded as statistically significant. Occasionally, especially if several outcome measures are being compared, the α level is set at 1% indicating a probability of &lt;0.01 will be regarded as statistically significant. 10.4 Detecting the difference between two means The test that is used to show that two mean values are significantly different from one another is the independent samples t-test (Module 5). The sample size needed for this test to have sufficient power can be calculated using Stata as shown in Worked Example 10.2. 10.4.1 Worked Example There is a hypothesis that the use of the oral contraceptive (OC) pill in premenopausal women can increase systolic blood pressure. A study was planned to test this hypothesis using a two sided t-test. The investigators are interesting in detecting an increase of at least 5 mm Hg systolic blood pressure in the women using OC compared to the non-OC users with 90% power at a 5% significance level. A pilot study shows that the SD of systolic blood pressure in the target group is 25 mm Hg and the mean systolic blood pressure of non-OC user women is 90 mm Hg. What is the minimum number of women in each group that need to be recruited for the study to detect this difference? Solution The effect size of interest is 5 mm Hg and the associated standard deviation is 25 mm Hg. For power of 90% and alpha of 5%, the sample size calculation using the power twomeans command in Stata is shown in Output 10.1. Output 10.1: Two independent samples t-test sample size calculation . power twomeans 90 95, sd(25) power(0.9) Performing iteration ... Estimated sample sizes for a two-sample means test t test assuming sd1 = sd2 = sd Ho: m2 = m1 versus Ha: m2 != m1 Study parameters: alpha = 0.0500 power = 0.9000 delta = 5.0000 m1 = 90.0000 m2 = 95.0000 sd = 25.0000 Estimated sample sizes: N = 1,054 N per group = 527 From the output, we can see that with 90% power we will need 527 participants in each group, i.e., 1054 participants in total. If the above were carried out by taking baseline measures of systolic blood pressure, and then again when the women were taking the OC pills, it would be a matched-pair study. We can compute the required sample size using the power pairedmeans command. Output 10.2: Paired samples t-test sample size using Worked Example 10.2 . power pairedmeans 90 95, corr(0) power(0.9) sd(25) Performing iteration ... Estimated sample size for a two-sample paired-means test Paired t test assuming sd1 = sd2 = sd Ho: d = d0 versus Ha: d != d0 Study parameters: alpha = 0.0500 ma1 = 90.0000 power = 0.9000 ma2 = 95.0000 delta = 0.1414 sd = 25.0000 d0 = 0.0000 corr = 0.0000 da = 5.0000 sd_d = 35.3553 Estimated sample size: N = 528 Assuming a correlation of 0 between the two sets of measurements, we can see that we will need 528 pairs of measurements to achieve a power of 90% (virtually the same as for an independent samples study). If we do not know the correlation between the two sets of observations, we can enter 0 for the correlation. If the correlation is positive, a zero for correlation would give a more conservative estimate of sample size required (i.e. estimate a sample size larger than necessary). While a negative correlation would require a bigger sample size than a zero correlation, it is relatively uncommon to encounter negative correlations between pairs. Any discussions on the effect of correlation on sample size is beyond the scope of this course. Thus, we will always assume a correlation of zero between paired measurements in this course. 10.5 Detecting the difference between two proportions The statistical test for deciding if there is a significant difference between two independent proportions is a Pearson’s chi-squared test (Module 7). The sample size required in each group to observe a difference in two independent proportions can be calculated using the power twoproportions command in Stata. Other than the power and alpha required for the test, the expected prevalence or incidence rate of the outcome factor needs to be estimated for each of the two groups being compared, based on what is known from other studies or what is expected. Occasionally, we may not know the expected proportion in one of the groups, e.g. in a randomised control trial of a novel intervention. In the sample size calculation for such a study, we should instead justify the minimum expected difference between the proportions based on what is important from a clinical or public health perspective. Based on the minimum difference, we can then derive the expected proportion for both groups. Note that the smaller the difference, the larger the sample size required. 10.5.1 Worked Example If we expect that the prevalence of smoking in two comparison groups (e.g. males and females) will be 35% and 20%. The sample size required in each group to show that the prevalences are significantly different at P&lt;0.05 with 80% power is shown in Output 10.3. Output 10.3: Sample size calculation for two independent proportions Estimated sample sizes for a two-sample proportions test Pearson&#39;s chi-squared test Ho: p2 = p1 versus Ha: p2 != p1 Study parameters: alpha = 0.0500 power = 0.8000 delta = -0.1500 (difference) p1 = 0.3500 p2 = 0.2000 Estimated sample sizes: N = 276 N per group = 138 From Output 10.3, we see that we would need 138 males and 138 females (i.e. a total sample size of 276 participants). What sample size would be required if the prevalence of smoking among men was 30%? Answer = 294 men and 294 women would be needed. [Command: power twoproportions .3 .2, test(chi2)] 10.6 Detecting an association using a relative risk The relative risk is used to describe the association between an exposure and an outcome variable if the sample has been randomly selected from the population. This statistic is often used to describe the effect or association of an exposure in a cross-sectional or cohort study or the effect/association of a treatment in an randomised controlled trial. To estimate the sample size required for the RR to have a statistically significant P value, i.e. to show a significant association, we need to define: - the size of the RR that is considered to be of clinical or public health importance; - the event rate (rate of outcome) among the group who are not exposed to the factor of interest (reference group); - the desired level of significance (usually 0.05); - the desired power of the study (usually 80% or 90%). In general, a RR of 2.0 or greater is considered to be of public health importance. However, a smaller RR can be important when exposure is high, for example say the relative risk of respiratory infection among young children with a parent who smokes is very small at approximately 1.2 but 25% of children are exposed to smoking in their home. The high exposure rate leads to a very large number of children who have preventable respiratory infections across the community. 10.6.1 Worked Example A study is planned to investigate the effect of an environmental exposure on the incidence of a certain common disease. In the general (unexposed) population the incidence rate of the disease is 50% and it is assumed that the incidence rate would be 75% in the exposed population. Thus the relative risk of interest would be 1.5 (i.e. 0.75 / 0.50). We want to detect this effect with 90% power at a 5% level of significance. Using the power twoproportions command, Output 10.4 is obtained. Output 10.4: Sample size calculation for relative risk Estimated sample sizes for a two-sample proportions test Pearson&#39;s chi-squared test Ho: p2 = p1 versus Ha: p2 != p1 Study parameters: alpha = 0.0500 power = 0.9000 delta = 0.2500 (difference) p1 = 0.5000 p2 = 0.7500 rrisk = 1.5000 Estimated sample sizes: N = 154 N per group = 77 From Output 10.4, we can see that for a control proportion of 0.5 and RR of 1.5, we need a total sample size of 154, that is 77 people would be needed in each of the exposure groups. 10.7 Detecting an association using an odds ratio If we are designing a case-control study, the appropriate measure of effect is an odds ratio. The method for estimating the sample size required to detect an odds ratio of interest is slightly different to that for the relative risk. However, the same parameters are required for the estimation: - the minimum OR to be considered clinically important; - the proportion of exposed among the control group; - the desired level of significance (usually 0.05); - the desired power of the study (usually 80% or 90%). 10.7.1 Worked Example A case-control study is designed to examine an association between an exposure and outcome factor. Existing literature shows that 30% of the controls are expected to be exposed. We want to detect a minimum OR of 2.0 with 90% power and 5% level of significance. . power twoproportions .3, test(chi2) oratio(2) power(0.9) Estimated sample sizes for a two-sample proportions test Pearson&#39;s chi-squared test Ho: p2 = p1 versus Ha: p2 != p1 Study parameters: alpha = 0.0500 power = 0.9000 delta = 0.1615 (difference) p1 = 0.3000 p2 = 0.4615 odds ratio = 2.0000 Estimated sample sizes: N = 376 N per group = 188 We find that 188 controls and 188 cases are required i.e. a total of 376 participants. This sample size would be smaller if we increased the effect size (OR) or reduced the study power to 80%. You could try this in Stata (answer: 141 per group). 10.8 Factors that influence power 10.8.1 Dropouts It is common to increase estimated sample sizes to allow for drop-outs or non-response. To account for drop-outs, the estimated sample size can be divided by (1 minus the dropout rate). Consider the following case: n-completed: the number who will complete the study (i.e. n after drop-out) n-recruited: the number who should be recruited (i.e. n before drop-out) d: drop-out rate (as a proportion - i.e. a number between 0 and 1) Then n-completed = n-recruited × (1 - d) Re-arranging this formula gives: n-recruited = n-completed ÷ (1 - d). 10.8.2 Unequal groups Many factors that come into play in a study can reduce the estimated power of a study. In clinical trials, it is not unusual for recruitment goals to be much harder to achieve than expected and therefore for the target sample size to be impossible to realise within the timeframe planned for recruitment. In case-control studies, the number of potential case participants available may be limited but study power can be maintained by enrolling a greater number of controls than cases. Or in an experimental study, more participants may be randomised to the new treatment group to test its effects accurately when much is known about the effect of standard care and a more precise estimate of the new treatment effect is required. However, there is a trade-off between increasing the ratio of group size and the total number that needs to be enrolled. Consider Worked Example 10.5: selecting an equal number of controls and cases would require 188 cases and 188 controls, a total of 376 participants. We may want to reduce the number of cases required, by selecting 2 controls for every case. When performing sample size calculations with unequal groups, Stata refers to cases as N2, and controls as N1. Selecting 2 controls (N1) per case (N2) (corresponding to a ratio of N2/N1 0.5 in Stata) would require 140 cases and 280 controls, a total of 420 participants. We can extend this example and investigate the impact of changing the ratio of controls per case. Table 10.2: Increasing controls per case Controls per caseStata's allocation ratio (N2/N1)Number of cases requiredNumber of controls requiredTotal participants required 11188188376 20.5140280420 30.3333124371495 40.25116462578 50.2111553664 60.1666108644752 70.1429105734839 80.125104825929 90.11111029161,018 100.11011,0061,107 This can be visualised graphically, as in Figure 10.1. We can see that the number of cases required drops off if we go from 1 to 2 controls per case, and again from 2 to 3 controls per case. Once we go from 3 to 4 controls per case, we only reduce the number of cases by 8 (124 vs 116 cases), but at an increase of 91 (371 vs 462) controls. Clearly, this reduction in cases is not offset by the extra controls required. 10.9 Limitations in sample size estimations In this module we have seen how to use Stata for estimating the sample size requirement of a study given the statistical test that will be used and the expected characteristics of the sample. However, once a study is underway, it is not unusual for sample size to be compromised by the lack of research resources, difficulties in recruiting participants or, in a clinical trial, participants wanting to change groups when information about the new experimental treatment rapidly becomes available in the press or on the internet. One approach that is increasingly being used is to conduct a blinded interim analysis say when 50% of the total data that are planned have been collected. In this, a statistician external to the research team who is blinded to the interpretation of the group code is asked to measure the effect size in the data with the sole aim of validating the sample size requirement. It is rarely a good idea to use an interim analysis to reduce the planned sample size and terminate a trial early because the larger the sample size, the greater the precision with which the treatment effect is estimated. However, interim analyses are useful for deciding whether the sample size needs to be increased in order to answer the study question and avoid a Type II error. 10.10 Summary In this module we have discussed the importance of conducting a clinical or epidemiological study with enough participants so that an effect or association can be identified if it exists (i.e. study power), and how this has to be balanced by the need to not enrol more participants than necessary because of resource issues. We have looked at the parameters that need to be considered when estimating the sample size for different studies and have used a look-up table to estimate required sample size for a prevalence study and Stata to estimate appropriate sample sizes in epidemiological research under the most straightforward situations. The common requirement in all the situations is that the researchers need to specify the minimum effect measure (e.g. difference in means, OR, RR etc) they want to detect with a given probability (usually 80% to 90%) at a certain level of significance (usually P&lt;0.05). The ultimate decision on the sample size depends on a compromise among different objectives such as power, minimum effect size, and available resources. To make the final decision, it is helpful to do some trial calculations using revised power and the minimum detectable effect measure.

What type of study would need to be conducted? Use the correct sample size table included in your notes to determine how many children would need to be enrolled for the confidence interval to be 2% 4% around the prevalence? What would the resulting prevalence estimates and 95% CIs be? Activity 10.2 We are planning an experimental study to test the use of a new drug to alleviate the symptoms of the common cold compared to the use of Vitamin C. Participants will be randomised to receive the new experimental drug or to receive Vitamin C. How many participants will be required in each group (power = 80%, level of significance = 5%). If the resolution of symptoms is 10% in the control group and 40% in the new treatment group? How large will the sample size need to be if we decide to recruit two control participants to every intervention group participant? If we decide to retain a 1:1 ratio of participants in the intervention and controls groups but the resolution of symptoms is 20% in the control group and 40% in the new treatment group? How many participants would we need to recruit (calculated in c) if a pilot study shows that 15% of people find the new treatment unpalatable and therefore do not take it? Activity 10.3 In a case-control study, we plan to recruit adult males who have been exposed to fumes from an industrial stack near their home and a sample of population controls in whom we expect that 20% may also have been exposed to similar fumes through their place of residence or their work. We want to show that an odds ratio of 2.5 for having respiratory symptoms associated with exposure to fumes is statistically significant. What statistical test will be needed to measure the association between exposure and outcome? How large will the sample size need to be to show that the OR of 2.5 is statistically significant at P &lt; 0.05 with 90% power if we want to recruit equal number of cases and controls? What would be the required sample size (calculated in b) if the minimum detectable OR were 1.5? If there are problems recruiting cases to detect an OR of 1.5 (as calculated in c), what would the sample size need to be if the ratio of cases to controls was increased to 1:3? Activity 10.4 In the above study to measure the effects of exposure to fumes from an industrial stack, we also want to know if the stack has an effect on lung function which can be measured as forced vital capacity in 1 minute (FEV1). This measurement is normally distributed in the population. If the research question is changed to wanting to show that the mean FEV1 in the exposed group is lower than the mean FEV1 in the control group what statistical test will now be required? Population statistics show that the mean FEV1 and its SD in the general population for males are 4.40 L (SD=1.25) which can be expected in the control group. We expect that the mean FEV1 in the cases may be 4.0 L. How many participants will be needed to show that this mean value is significantly different from the control group with P &lt; 0.05 with an 80% power if we want to recruit equal number in each group? How much larger will the sample size need to be if the mean FEV1 in the cases is 4.20 L?
